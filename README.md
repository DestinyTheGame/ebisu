# ebisu

Ebisu, named after the Black Armory Vault, is a Vault and Armor Management
application for Destiny 2. It's not uncommon to have 100-200 armor pieces per
character/class when you're passioned about build crafting in this game. That
those volumes it becomes really hard to keep you vault, clean, and organized.

## Development

This repo contains 2 different projects:

- `library` This is the API that does all the parsing, filtering, and management
  of the data.
- `app` The application UI that consumes the library and presents the data.

### library

```
npm run test
```

### app
